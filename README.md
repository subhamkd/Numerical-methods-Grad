This repository contains the implementation of different matrix solving and nonlinear equation solving methods in python. 

### The cubic spline interpolation was written following the procedure described in the following document :
McKinley, Sky, and Megan Levine. "Cubic spline interpolation." College of the Redwoods 45.1 (1998): 1049-1060.

### In the methods that use iterative techniques, error vs iterations are plotted
